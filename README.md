## The Moving to Opportunity Experiment & Multiple Regression with Inference

Millions of low-income Americans live in high-poverty neighborhoods, which also tend to be racially segregated
and sometimes have issues with community violence. While social scientists have long believed a lack
of investment in these neighborhoods contributes to negative outcomes for the residents living in them, it
is often difficult to establish a causal link between neighborhood conditions and individual outcomes. The
Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration was designed to test whether offering housing vouchers to
families living in public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods could lead to better experiences and outcomes
by providing financial assistance to move to higher income neighborhoods.
Between 1994 and 1998 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development enrolled 4,604 low-income
households from public housing projects in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York in MTO,
randomly assigning enrolled families in each site to one of three groups: (1) The low-poverty voucher group
received special MTO vouchers, which could only be used in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10%
and counseling to assist with relocation, (2) the traditional voucher group received regular section 8 vouchers,
which they could use anywhere, and (3) the control group, who received no vouchers but continued to qualify
for any project-based housing assistance they were entitled to receive. Today we will use the MTO data to
learn if being given the opportunity to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods actually improved participants’
economic and subjective wellbeing.
